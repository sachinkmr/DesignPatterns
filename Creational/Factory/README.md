## Also known as
Virtual Constructor

## Intent
Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses
decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.

## Explanation
Real world example

> Blacksmith manufactures weapons. Elves require Elvish weapons and orcs require Orcish weapons. Depending on the customer at hand the right type of blacksmith is summoned.

In plain words

> It provides a way to delegate the instantiation logic to child classes.

Wikipedia says

> In class-based programming, the factory method pattern is a creational pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method—either specified in an interface and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by derived classes—rather than by calling a constructor.

 
## Applicability
Use the Factory Method pattern when

* A class can't anticipate the class of objects it must create
* A class wants its subclasses to specify the objects it creates
* Classes delegate responsibility to one of several helper subclasses, and you want to localize the knowledge of which helper subclass is the delegate
